XGBoost is a machine learning framework that uses decision trees and gradient boosting to build predictive models. It works by ensembling multiple decision trees together based on the score associated with different leaf nodes in a tree. \n",

The originial dataset only had the values \"Female\" and \"Male\" for Sex.  We assigned the value \"1\" to Female and \"2\" to Male . As part of the data prepartion effort we used the Pandas function \"get_dummies\" to convert the remaining domain values into numerical equiavlents.  For instance the \"Education\" column was turned into several sub-columns named after the value in the column.  For instance the \"Education_HS-grad\" has a value of \"1\" for when that was the orginial categorical value and a value of \"0\" for other cateogries."

In this case, 18.9% of men from the test dataset have their loans approved but only 3.4% of women have their loans approved. If we wished to ensure than men and women get their loans approved the same percentage of the time, that is a fairness concept called \"demographic parity\". An XGBoost model intially defaults to a 0.50 threshold, which is what appears upon initial examination.  One way to achieve demographic parity would be to have different classification thresholds for females and males in our model. You'll notice there is a button on the tool labeled \"demographic parity\". When we press this button, the tool will take the cost ratio into account, and come up with ideal separate thresholds for men and women that will achieve demographic parity over the test dataset.\n",

In this case, demographic parity can be found with both groups getting loans approved/predicting a high income ~17.7% of the time.  This occurs when the female threshold is set to 0.19 and the male threshold is set to 0.54. Because of the vast difference in the properties of the female and male training data in this 1994 census dataset, we need quite different thresholds to achieve demographic parity. With the high male threshold you may notice there are many more false negatives than before, and with the low female threshold there are many more false positives than before.

    "The use of these features can help shed light on subsets of your data on which your classifier is performing very differently. Understanding biases in your datasets and data slices on which your model has disparate performance are very important parts of analyzing a model for fairness. There are many approaches to improving fairness, including augmenting training data, building fairness-related loss functions into your model training procedure, and post-training inference adjustments like those seen in WIT. We think that WIT provides a great interface for furthering ML fairness learning, but of course there is no silver bullet to improving ML fairness.\n",
