The starting point is a table, `movielens.ratings`, with three columns: a user id, an item id, and the rating that the user gave the product. This table can be sparse -- users donâ€™t have to rate all products. Then, based on just the ratings, the technique finds similar users and similar products and determines the rating that a user would give an unseen product. Then, we can recommend the products with the highest predicted ratings to users, or target products at users with the highest predicted ratings.\n",
