# Vertex AI: Qwikstart

In this lab, you will walk through an introductory, end-to-end experience of training and serving a custom TensorFlow model on Vertex AI.

## Learning objectives

* Train a TensorFlow model locally in a Vertex Notebook.
* Create a managed dataset artifact for experiment tracking.
* Containerize your training code and push it Google Container Registry.
* Run a training job on Vertex AI with your custom model container.
* Use Vertex TensorBoard to monitor model performance during training.
* Deploy your trained model to a Vertex Prediction endpoint for serving predictions.
* Request an online prediction and see the response.
